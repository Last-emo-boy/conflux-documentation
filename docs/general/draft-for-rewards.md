# guideline(FC amount Only as Reference)

Basically following the idea:

- list reward range for each kind of contribution
- specifying reward examples

So we can know how to determine rewards for contributors case-by-case but not that randomly.

1. Creating issues (should be added "ACCEPTED" label):
   1. 16 ~ 80 FC for each accepted issue.
   2. Amount differs according to the importance of the issue. For example, typo and grammar mistakes will be considered of less importance than the fact expiracy or code sample running failures. Issues involving technical details will also be considered much more importance. And with more information provided, more rewards will be granted.
      1. Involving more technical details
      2. More about Conflux-related but not general blockchain knowledge
      3. ...
   3. Examplesï¼š
      1. Pointing out typo or grammer mistake: 16 FC
      2. Suggesting new article about certain topic in Conflux: ...

2. Creating pull requests or new contents (should be merged into main branch):
   1. 16 ~ 640 FC and even more for each merged pull request.
   2. It is encouraged to always create an issue before the pull request is created. If a pull request fully resolved an issue, at least it will be rewarded the same as the reward of the issue no matter how little work it requires.
   3. 25% bonus rewards if the pull request creator is resolving the issue he or she created.
   4. Amount differs according to the efforts devoted in the new contents, the importance of the contents will also be considered, but with less priority.
   5. Examples:
      1. Fix a typo: 16 FC.
      2. Fix a technical detail mistake: 80 FC.
